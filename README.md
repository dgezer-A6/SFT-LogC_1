# SFT-LogC
Here, you can use the machine learning model to predict SFT-concentration profiles of surfactant molecules via QSPR approach. 
You can obtain surface tension-concentration plots of surfactant molecules by providing SMILES version of each molecule in an Excel file as given in "4_Unseen_Molecules".
Download all the files within this repository and run Apply_Model.ipynb to predict the SFT-log(c) isotherms. Add model file paths of the three parameters () in Apply_Model.ipynb as described in the file.
